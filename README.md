A single-feed millimeter-wave (mmWave) tripleband substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna with dual-sense circular polarization (CP) etched on a single substrate is proposed. A SIW cavity operating in TM210 mode is carved with a circular slot to realize upper band radiation. A circular patch is placed in the circular slot for lower band radiation. Middle band radiation is achieved by the coupling between the SIW cavity and circular patch. By introducing asymmetry on both circular slot and circular patch, CP is obtained at the upper and lower band respectively. The polarization states of the three bands are right-hand circular polarization (RHCP), linear polarization (LP) and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP). Three pairs of vias are introduced in SIW transmission line to realize good impedance matching for the three bands. Two antenna prototypes are fabricated and their performances are evaluated. Simulated and measured results agree very well. Small frequency ratios are achieved and each band can be adjusted flexibly. Moreover, the proposed mmWave triple-band CP antenna has simple structure and low-profile, which make it easy to be applied in future mmWave wireless communication systems.
